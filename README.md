# doctor-appts
Simple flask app to manage the busy schedules of Dr. Strange and Dr. Who

# How and what?
If you want to run this locally, you'll want to run `app.py` and it should spin up and run locally
Try visiting localhost:5000/create-appointment and there is a form you can use to create appointments

Visit localhost:5000/get-schedules to see the schedules for both doctors

Lastly `test.py` is used for tests against the scheduler, it's not too robust but something I had used
